# Model Notes


This a model from the article:  
**Mathematical modelling of calcium wave propagation in mammalian airway epithelium: evidence for regenerative ATP release.**   
Warren NJ, Tawhai MH, Crampin EJ. _Exp Physiol_ 2010 Jan;95(1):232-49
[19700517](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19700517) ,  
**Abstract:**   
Airway epithelium has been shown to exhibit intracellular calcium waves after
mechanical stimulation. Two classes of mechanism have been proposed to explain
calcium wave propagation: diffusion through gap junctions of the intracellular
messenger inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3), and diffusion of paracrine
extracellular messengers such as ATP. We have used single cell recordings of
airway epithelium to parameterize a model of an airway epithelial cell. This
was then incorporated into a spatial model of a cell culture where both
mechanisms for calcium wave propagation are possible. It is shown that a
decreasing return on the radius of Ca2+ wave propagation is achieved as the
amount of ATP released from the stimulated cell increases. It is therefore
shown that for a Ca2+ wave to propagate large distances, a significant
fraction of the intracellular ATP pool would be required to be released.
Further to this, the radial distribution of maximal calcium response from the
stimulated cell does not produce the same flat profile of maximal calcium
response seen in experiential studies. This suggests that an additional
mechanism is important in Ca2+ wave propagation, such as regenerative release
of ATP from cells downstream of the stimulated cell.
